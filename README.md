# Tree decompositions of graphs in ILPs

I wrote this model in IBM's [Optimization Programming Language (OPL)](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSA5P_12.9.0/ilog.odms.ide.help/OPL_Studio/opllangref/topics/opl_langref_modeling_language.html).

This model encodes an integer linear program. The integer solutions encode [tree decompositions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_decomposition) of a graph.
